Cypress and Selenium Example
===

To work with this application `npm install` and then following commands are available:

  * `npm run start`: runs the app at `http://localhost:3000`
  * `npx cypress open`: opens the cypress test runner
  * `npx cypress run`: runs all cypress test on a headless test runner
  * `npx wdio wdio.conf.js`: run selenium tests

The web app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but
is relatively meaningless.
